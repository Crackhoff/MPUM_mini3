# MPUM_mini3
This repository contains third miniproject for Probabilistic Methods in Machine Learning course @ Jagiellonian University. The project focused on comparing several non linear classification Machine Learning algorithms. 

## Data used in this project:

In 'phishing.data' file there is a dataset containing 11055 instances and 30 features. The last column is the target variable. The dataset is a collection of features that can be used to classify a website as phishing or not phishing. The dataset is available at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/phishing+websites.

## Algorithms implemented in this project:
- SVM with several kernels
- Decision Tree
- k-Nearest Neighbours
